# odin-recipes
This project was for TheOdinProject to show what I have learned so far. However, I just came back from vacation at the time of writing this so I believe I have forgotten a lot of stuff that I learned.

This project aims to create a website where you can choose between recipes and be brought to their respective pages. I will demonstrate the skills of being able to use basic HTML and ability to create basic website with various webpages and a homepage.
