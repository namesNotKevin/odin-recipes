    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried eggs are an classic breakfast item that can go with many different meals. They are an amazing backup food for if you forget to make something to eat for any meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable or olive oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 10-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
            (A small drop of water dropped into it should immediately sizzle.) Carefully break eggs into hot oil, dropping them from right above the surface to prevent hot oil from splashing. 
            Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Tilt the skillet toward you so oil pools against the side of the pan. 
            Using a spoon, baste eggs with hot oil, aiming at the uncooked portions of the egg whites and avoiding the yolk. 
            Continue basting until eggs are puffy and cooked, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and serve.</li>
        </ol>
